# BATTLESHIP 
My Python site is based on the classic boardgame of the same name. In my game, the user's computer randomly places 5 ships across the grid. The user must try and locate each ship before they run out of guesses. 

## How to play the game
1. Your computer will randomly generate 5 Battleships, across the grid.

2. You will have 30 guesses per game.

3. The player must select a row (1, 2, 3...), and then a column (A, B, C...), in order to guess the coordinates.

4. Tne player must try and sink the entire fleet, before they run out of guesses.

5. Sunken ships are marked with an "X."

6. Missed ships are marked with a "0."

## User Experience (UX)

I wanted the gsme to be both easy to navigate through and easy to play. 

I wanted the instructions to be easy to read and learn for users.
